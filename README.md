# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to create a UFO sightings website utlizing HTML, Javascript and bootstrap.  A dynamic table of UFO Sighting articles is to be created and displayed on a website. The table will contain filters to filter the data by multiple criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape).


## Results
An interactive webpage has beeen created that allows the user to filter data regarding specifics of UFO sightings. As seen in the below figure the filters available to the user include Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. By entering specific inputs in one or more of the filters the data will be filtered and displayed on the website based on the user's specific input. The below figure shows an example filter using state (ca) and shape (light).

## Summary

### One drawback of this webpage

One drawback of this website is the filter functionality. When using the filters the exact string must be known which includes the case (upper or lower case).

### Recommendations for further development

- Allow partial matches in the search filters to return appropriate results. 
- Allow for matches to be case insensitive.  
- Add additional filters (duration and comments) with the above 2 recommendations applied to these filters.
